title: ClapIt - Social network application analysis using machine learning
---

![](/img/social-network.jpg)

Social networking market is booming over the past several years, however, if you are not gaint companies like Facebook, intagram or twitter, life could be very hard. This article will take a social networking app - ClapIt as example, and I will cover the following aspects:

- 1,Background and the datasets 
  The company collaborate with some movie producers and select new actors from their users by holding events in the app to let the users post audition video clips. The user who gets the most claps(likes) get the role.
- 2, Problems identified
- 3, Outcomes and possible solutions

**Dataset:**

When I initially got the data, I ask myself: “maybe I can have a general idea of the users/datasets by have a quick look at the number of claps (likes) that users made as it’s just a single tap away for users to do.

The result was making me a bit worried as it’s showing that most of the users are not even bother to make claps… this may be reasonable as the more claps a user gets the more likely he/she will win the competition , seeing that, to some extent, users are sort of competitors, so it would not be surprised if users are reluctant to send out claps.

 I also plotted another graph, the right graph is showing the correlations between features such as number of claps/comment/follows/activities/posts. From it we can see that the  correlation is quite low, the higher ones are actually because: the number of follows is part of the number of activities so that figure is not really helpful.

Seeing the plots, now I understand that the users is using this app in a really really inactive way, and I need to find other ways to explore the dataset if any correlation exist .


**Thinking of the data:**

Then I asked myself: what can be potentially done to solve these problems:

For example:
Any factors that make users addicted to the app?
Can we predict the user growth?
Any content can be a indicator to things like active user/good posts/etc.?

**Challenges:**

The contents across the datasets are not consistent and this will causes huge problems when modelling.
No activity logs for users, I cannot have an understand of when and for how long a user use the app, as that is the most accurate measure as the user may just browsing without doing anything. This means that if I wish to examine a user, I need to rely on other possible factors to see how active a user is, for example, when and how many a user posts, likes or comment and so on.

**Insights & Models built**

Firstly, I asked myself: “can I know how likely a user is still use the app and how often they will keep using it”
As the picture shows:

Frequency is the number of day a user showed up 
Recency is the age of the user when the user made the most recent visit

![](/img/3-alive.jpg)

We can see that the higher frequency, the higher the recency, the user is expected to show up more times in future  as the yellow part shows, we can all see how tiny that part is, right? That is, it is unlikely to see them again.

the lower frequency, the higher recency, the user is expected to be still alive,  also, tiny yellow area means small number of user is alive.


Then, I asked: “for those ones that are coming back, are they acting in the same way?”

The answer is NO, and there are several different patterns:

Top-left graph is a never-come-back user, we can see the chance of coming back is almost zero

Top-right graph showing a user using and not using the app back and forth.

The bottom-left one showing a very frequent user, guess who that is? - a Clapit staff member

The bottom-right one  shows a user using the app and stopped it, and then after 15 months, he came back again. 

**Model: Logistic regression**

Lastly, I am thinking, can I simplify them into two groups to represent long-lasters and never-come-backs, to do that, I need to set a threshold, in this case, 45 days of user's’ life-time. Then, I examined whether a user clap, comment, follow or post within a week after creating their account, and the result is promising:

Lastly, I am thinking, can I simplify them into two groups to represent long-lasters and never-come-backs, to do that, I need to set a threshold, in this case, 45 days of user's’ life-time. Then, I examined whether a user clap, comment, follow or post within a week after creating their account, and the result is promising:

The model works well and the probability of a correct prediction is 71.3% and it beat the dummy model (dummy model, is like, to make the prediction by randomly toss a coin)

So, it can be concluded as simple as: if we let a user followed someone or posted something within the first week, the chance that user will  became a long-laster will be lifted up by 0.82 plus 1.22 times  than those who didn’t do so.


**Model: Time series**

I was wishing to see if there is any strong relations between the dates of auditions (those red vertical lines) and the weekly user growth, however, as shown in the graph, the competitions have no apparent influence on it.

The pink vertical lines are the period of a previous one-off event and that even did convert lots of new users. We will come back to that later.

This graph is a prediction till end of Feb 2018 based on the current new user weekly growth. We can see that based on the past weekly user growth,  the growth for the next several months are not that promising.


**Limitations and things to improve:**

![](/img/9-limitations.jpg)

I was trying to build a model to see whether certain hashtags are the indicator of a popular post, but the model doesn’t working that well.  As you can see those hashtags above, they are certain possible ones that may lead to a popular post, however the chances are low.

If you still remember the new user weekly growth graph, the dramatic growth in August last year, is actually related to the “makemeamuse”  competition. And also, we can see that from the hashtags, there are large number of posts that were tagged with related hashtags.

**Conclusion:**

Through the analysis of this above, the most urgent issues to solve for this app are to understand why users do not use the app and leave,  and anything thing we can do to make users stay. Although it is still not sure why they stop using the app, it is confident to suggest that:

In order to make a user stay, trying everything to let them follow other users and make some posts within the first week after creating the account.
